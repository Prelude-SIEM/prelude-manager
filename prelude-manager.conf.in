# exchange. These should be discarded and regenerated once a day, once a

# If you want a given reporting plugin to be protected against

# [relaying]
#
# If you want the message caught by this manager to be relayed.
# You can use boolean AND and OR to make the rule.
#
# parent-managers = x.x.x.x || y.y.y.y && z.z.z.z
#
# This mean the emission should occur on x.x.x.x or, if it fail,
# on y.y.y.y and z.z.z.z (if one of the two host in the AND fail, 
# the emission will be considered as failed involving saving the 
# message locally).


# [db]

# The type of database (mysql/pgsql).
# type = mysql

# Host the database is listening on.
# host = localhost

# Port the database is listening on.
# port = 3306

# Name of the database.
# name = prelude

# Username to be used to connect the database.

# The Textmod plugin allow to report alert as text
# in a file. Or to dump theses alert to stderr. 
#
# The default logfile for this plugin is /var/log/prelude.log
#

# [TextMod]
#
# logfile = stderr
# logfile = @prefix@/var/log/prelude.log




# [XmlMod]
#
# The Xmlmod plugin allow to report alert as IDMEF XML in a file. 
# Or to dump theses alert to stderr. 
#
# The default logfile for this plugin is /var/log/prelude-xml.log
#
# Tell Xmlmod to disable output file buffering.
# This will prevent XML alerts to be truncated and thus make real-time
# parsing easier:
#
# disable-buffering
#
#
# Tell Xmlmod to check generated XML against IDMEF DTD:
# validate
# 
# Tell Xmlmod to produce a pretty, human readable xml output:
# format
#
# logfile = stderr
# logfile = @prefix@/var/log/prelude-xml.log



# [Debug]
#
# Print the value of each element:
# verbose 
#
# Be aggressive, print strings even if consistency checks fail 
# (may lead to crash):
#

#
# Use wide format for lists:
# wide-format
