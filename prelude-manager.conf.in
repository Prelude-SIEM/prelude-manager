[Prelude Manager]

# Address where the Prelude Manager is listening on.
# if value is "unix", it mean the report server is listening
# on the same machine via a local (UNIX) socket.
#
listen = unix;

# only if listening on other than 'unix' socket.
#
# port = 5554


# If you want the message caught by this manager to be relayed.
# You can use boolean AND and OR to make the rule.
#
# relay-manager = x.x.x.x || y.y.y.y && z.z.z.z
#
# This mean the emission should occur on x.x.x.x or, if it fail,
# on y.y.y.y and z.z.z.z (if one of the two host in the AND fail, 
# the emission will be considered as failed involving saving the 
# message locally).
