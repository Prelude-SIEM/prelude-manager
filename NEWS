- Improve thread safety when evicting events to disk.

- Handle IDMEF message version tag, which will be used in upcoming

- Update libev, and GnuLib code.


* 2008-04-01, prelude-manager-0.9.12:

- Use libev in place of the server-logic architecture: libev provides
  the most scalable event notification mechanism available on a given
  operating system.

- New connection-timeout option, governing the maximum number of
  seconds a client might take to authenticate (default: 10 seconds).

- Fix a possible file descriptor leak on connection closure error.

- Massive cleanup of the build process, enable RELRO when possible.

- Fix a number of potential race in the reverse relaying code.

- When reverse relaying messages, encode the same message once for all
  recipients: this improve performance with more than one reverse
  relaying client (was a long time FIXME).

- Libev introduction also fix a rare issue where server-logic would not
  notice a dead connection.



* 2008-02-07, prelude-manager-0.9.11.2:

  missing strsep (Solaris). Fix #277.



* 2008-02-05, prelude-manager-0.9.11:

- In case a lot of message were being processed, the heartbeat timer
  could be delayed for a long period of time.

- The old scheduler algorithm could be unfair when certain message priority
  were not available for processing. We now appropriatly handle repartition
  to others priority messages.

- Message of the same priority could be processed in the wrong order when
  on-disk buffers were used.

- No integrity check were performed on orphan on-disk buffer in case of an
  operating system crash. By using the prelude-failover API, we can now
  detect possibly corrupted disk buffer, or resume at the time we stopped
  recovering them.

- New sched-priority and sched-buffer-size configuration options.

- Fix a bug where several relaying plugin instance would only forward
  their message to a single Manager.



* 2007-10-02, prelude-manager-0.9.10:

- Make threshold act like a real threshold: pass every Nth events
  in the defined amount of seconds.

- Allow mixing Limit and Threshold.

- Do not share the tresholding hash accross thresholding plugin instance:
  previously, the shared hash would result in strange thresholding plugin
  behavior if you had several instance of thresholding loaded.

- Various bug fixes concerning plugin instance un-subscribtion (unsubscribtion
  of certain plugin was not triggered).


* 2007-09-23, prelude-manager-0.9.9.1:

- Fix for new libprelude (0.9.15) runtime warning.

- Add documentation for SQLite3 in the template configuration file
  (Sébastien Tricaud <toady at gscore.org>).

- Update configuration template, add documentation for Prelude
  generic TCP options.

- Implement modified patch from Pierre Chifflier <chifflier@inl.fr>
  to fix the example log path (fix #224).

- Move IDMEF message normalization in the scheduler, rather than
  doing it upon reception. This remove some load from the server
  and allow Prelude-Manager own IDMEF messages to go through the
  normalizer path.

- Implement heartbeat->analyzer normalization.

- Improve IPv4 / IPv6 address normalization.
  IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses are now mapped back to IPv4.
  Additionally, the Normalize plugin now provide two additionals option:
   ipv6-only: Map any incoming IPv4 address to IPv6.
   keep-ipv4-mapped-ipv6: do not map IPv4 mapped IPv6 addresses back to IPv4.

- Make a difference between exceptional report plugin failure (example:
  a single message couldn't be processed) and "global" plugin failure
  (example: database server is down). We use a different failover for
  'exceptional' failure, so that we don't try to reinsert a bogus message
  (fix #247).

- Start of a Prelude-Manager manpages (#236).

- Various bug fixes.


* 2007-05-02, prelude-manager-0.9.8:

        - Initial implementation of the 'thresholding' plugin, allowing you to
          suppress events after a certain limit/threshold.

        - Filters hooking to a reporting plugin are now OR'ed instead of being
          AND'ed. AND is already possible by hooking filtering plugin one with
          another.

        - Improved error reporting.

        - Minor bug fixes.


* 2007-03-16, prelude-manager-0.9.7.2:

        - Various bug fixes.


* 2006-12-21, prelude-manager-0.9.7.1:

        - Fix compilation issue on system where ferror is not declared as a function,
          regression introduced in 0.9.7 (#186).


* 2006-12-20, prelude-manager-0.9.7:

        - Fix a startup problem on system with different address of different family
          mapping to the same IP.

        - Fix for system using the GnuLib poll replacement modules. The module was
          broken when used in conjunction with server socket.

        - Various portability fixes (this release should compile and run on OSX out of the box).

        - Fix possible undefined reference to GnuLib symbols.

        - Verbose error message in case of Authentication initialization failure.

          validation issue.

        - Normalize analyzer(*).node.

        - Fix OpenBSD getaddrinfo() problem.



* 2006-06-14, prelude-manager-0.9.5:

        - Store Prelude-Manager FIFO into the profile backup directory so that FIFO
          are per profile. Fix #151.

        - Update libwrap check, don't statically link libwrap. Cleanup. Fix #144.

        - XMLmod: Implement CorrelationAlert processing.

          sanitize IDMEF Address and IDMEF Service classes.

        - When an analyzer have read and write permission to prelude-manager,
          avoid acting as an echo server, don't send received message from this
          analyzer to itself.

        - When no listen address is specified, try to bind all
          system address (both ipv4/ipv6).

        - Send an alert to the peer on handshake failure, so that
          the peer have some information on what happened.

          database plugin, to handle file based database (SQLite).

        - prelude-manager has been updated to check the loaded revocation

        Please bear with us and try it for yourself :-)

        - Clients using libprelude can now request copies of alert from a
          Manager. Additionally, Prelude-Manager will backup alerts received
          while a 'querying' analyzer was offline and emit them when it reconnect.

          given client is allowed to do.

        - Support failover at the Report plugin level, allowing for example to setup
          a fallback if one of the report plugin fail (example: if the database used
          by a report plugin goes down).

        - Improved scheduler fairness across different sensors.

        - Use ephemeral Diffie Hellman parameters.

        - Allow loading of multiple instances of the same plugin, your Manager can now
          report to an unlimited number plugin instances (example: you can now have multiple
          database).

        - Modular filtering system, allowing to define IDMEF criteria, and to bind action
          to be issued when an event match these rules.

        - Use libpreludedb.

        - Ipv6 support.
        - Enhanced portability (Should now build successfully on architecture such as Tru64/AIX).
        - Support plugin dl-preopening on platform without dlopen() or dlsym().
