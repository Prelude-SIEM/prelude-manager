	new version, it is hard to remind all the enhancement made in this release.
	Please bear with us and try it for yourself :-)

	  given client is allowed to do.

	- Allow loading of multiple instances of the same plugin, your Manager can now 
	  report to an unlimited number plugin instances (example: you can now have multiple 
	  database).

	- Modular filtering system, allowing to define IDMEF criteria, and to bind action 
	  to be issued when an event match theses rules.

	- Use libpreludedb.

	- Ipv6 support.
	- Enhanced portability (Should now build successfully on architecture such as Tru64/AIX).
