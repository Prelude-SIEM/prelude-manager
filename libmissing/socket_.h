/* The following define makes sure we get all the prototypes from the
   header files.  getaddrinfo is only available if _WIN32_WINNT >=
   0x0501 (that symbol is set indiriectly through WINVER).  This has
   the following two (potential) problems:

     1) winsock2.h must not have been included before this symbol
        is set (I think).

     2) There may be some _reason_ for all prototypes not being
        available with the default settings.  Such as if some APIs are
        not available on older Windows hosts.  However, getaddrinfo
        (which need >= 0x0501) should be available on Windows 95 and
        later, according to:
        http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winsock/winsock/getaddrinfo_2.asp
